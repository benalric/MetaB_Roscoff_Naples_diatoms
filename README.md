# MetaB_Roscoff_Naples_diatoms

In this repository, you will find a tutorial explaining how we processed metabarcoding data (18S V4 rDNA region) to report on the genetic diversity of diatom communities in two coastal sites with contrasting hydrological features but recurring annual sequences of plankton species: the SOMLIT-Astan and LTER-Marechiara stations, located respectively in Roscoff (France, Western English Channel) and Naples (Italy, Mediterranean Sea, Gulf of Naples).

Data analysis was done using R version 3.6.3 and a compute cluster handled by the scheduler SLURM. This document was compiled with the *rmarkdown* package version 2.8.

The data were produced as part of the article:
Caracciolo M., C. Berney, B. Alric, R. Piredda, A. Zingone, D. Sarno, I. Percopo, S. Romac, F. Le Gall, F. Rigaut-Jalabert, N. Simon, N. Henry. Insight into diatoms diversity at two European coastal sites (LTER-Marechiara in the Mediterranean Sea and SOMLIT-Astan in the Western English Channel) using a DNA Metabarcoding approach, submitted to the journal *Marine Ecology* for special issue *Marine plankton ecology in the Gulf of Naples*.
